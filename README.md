# pytorch-tutorials
I have studied the tutorials from the official pytorch website ( https://pytorch.org/tutorials/ ),
and made some comments and a few modifications on some of them.
I have attached tutorials about:
1. basic operations on tensors and autograd
2. constructing a basic neural network structure
3. importing and finetuning different pre-trained networks
4. training a classifier on a labeled dataset
5. examples of image segmentation, neural style transfer, spatial transformation network, and adversarial model
